[AI in Software Engineering at Google: Progress and Path Ahead](https://research.google/blog/ai-in-software-engineering-at-google-progress-and-the-path-ahead/)

## Why I Find It Interesting 
This article is interesting because it goes into depth of how AI is revolutionizing software development at Google. 
AI-powered tools assist in the following: code generation, debugging, and optimization which all allow developers to work more efficiently. 
In addition, AI now has the ability to predict and fix bugs before they occur which has the potential to drastically improve software reliability. This is especially interesting to note because it will change the way programmers approach their debugging techniques.  
With Google's reputable reputation, it will be interesting to see how big companies such as themselves progress in the next few years given the current growth.

## Noah Perelmuter - Additional Comment
This is a very cool article, I think AI will revolutionize the way we code, and think of programming in general, in the future (and already is).
